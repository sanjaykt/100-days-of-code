# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 18: January 20, 2017 Friday

**Today's Progress**:  Worked on FCC Wikipedia Viewer app. HTML and CSS files are done. Made a successful API call to Wikipedia.
Now, I need to display the result in a formatted way on the page

**Thoughts**  This is very time consuming… Hopeful worth it one day!


### Day 17: January 19, 2017 Thursday

**Today's Progress**:  Started with Back End part of the Web Developer Bootcamp course at Udemy. Wrote my first Express app. It’s very small, just a baby steps… Learning fundamental first before understanding and writing complex codes.
Also, started with Wikipedia Viewer app. Did some research and set up files on my computer! Tomorrow, I will starting with actual coding

**Thoughts**  Now it’s starting make sense what Node js is an what Express is. Express is a framework that we use to set up our web app. It’s a template that is lightweight meaning we have more flexibility of how we want to set up. At the same time, it’s little difficult to start from. However, I have great teaching Colt Steels. He explains this concept very well… really appreciate his way of explaining


### Day 16: January 18, 2017 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:  Finished Front End part of Web Developer Bootcamp Udemy course and starting with backend
Also, worked through Project 6 of JavaScript30. Learned ES6 fetch() method and how to work with data it fetches.
Read the online book on github called “You don’t know JS”

**Thoughts**  Difficult stuff. Too many loose pieces to put together


### Day 15: January 17, 2017 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:  Worked through Udemy Web Development Bootcamp work alone project called Patatap clone.
I learned how to include external library and learned to how to use it in our project.

**Thoughts**  Still a long way to go… but I am not constantly putting time in it.


### Day 14: January 16, 2017 Monday

**Today's Progress**:  Worked through 4rth project of JavaScript30 and learned more about Array.Prototype methods.
Fished the worked alone “Todo List” project of Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp course at Udemy.

**Thoughts** 


### Day 13: January 15, 2017 Sanday

**Today's Progress**:  Working through the 3rd project at JavaScript30.com . In this project, I am learning Array methods like filter(), map(), reduce() ext. It’s is little challenging. I will have work on it, practice it
Also, I am progressing through Udemy course making Todo List

**Thoughts** Lot to learn… 


### Day 12: January 14, 2017 Saturday

**Today's Progress**:  Finished the third project called “Playing with CSS Variables and JS”. CSS variables is a new topic I learned today. Also, I learned about dataset property to access our custom data that starts with data-something

Moreover, I am making a to-do list with a Udemy course. And, I am learning a lot about JQuery and different methods that can be used easily. I am also trying to read JQuery documentation, so as to rely on it in the future.

**Thoughts** It’s frustrating at a time because there is so much to know, understand and apply. But, if I keep at it, one day it will all fall in place!


### Day 11: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress** Finished 2nd project of JavaScript30. Leaned above CSS transform : rotate and transform properties

### Day 10: January 12, 2017 Thursday

**Today's Progress**:  Finished the first project called “Drum kit”. It’s first of the 30 projects that I will be working on and learning from it
Also, I went through some WebStorm tutorial and learn hot to integrate git and github. I integrated the git and pushed the repository on github

**Thoughts** got to keep it up...


### Day 9: January 11, 2017 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on first exercise of JavaScript 30. Encountered some ES6 format. Took some time to figure out how to write it in Webstorm without it flagging it wrong code. 
Learned about different tags like <kbd> <audio>

**Thoughts** got to keep it up


### Day 8: January 10, 2017 Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Did not work on  wikipedia project today instead I worked through some JavaScript exercises. I am in process of building a color game using JavaScript.

I singed up for https://javascript30.com/  This may be the best way to insure that I complete one assingment every day and get practice building something in JavaScript.
I started reading book called “You don’t know JS”. It’s is free and it’s on github

**Thoughts** I am determined to keep working at it.


### Day 7: January 9, 2017 Monday
**Today's Progress**: Spent two hours trying to figure out the how to write query string to get data from wikipedia for my FCC Wikipedia project. Read documentation at https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page . This has been a challenge. First of all, I don’t what I was looking at.

So looked at the code (API call) someone wrote in the project and then try to figure out why it was written the way it was written.

There is something call “generator=search” that would bring the result to a search term. Then there is extract and parameters suffix “ex” that I could not figure out what it was.
Also, I worked on writing snippets of code for Udemy JavaScript course.

**Thoughts** This is frustrating business because of the amount of information I have digest and remember, but it is worth it at the end


### Day 6: January 8, 2017 Sunday
**Today's Progress**: Did some JavaScript exercises with Udemy course. Researched how to connect Wikipedia API to my project. It’s very confusing. I had to look at the code others wrote in order to figure it out. I could not figure it reading documentation at Wikipedia; maybe I don’t know what I am looking at.
**Thoughts** Once I know how to fetch data from wikipedia with the search term, it will be easy to iterate through it and display the data


### Day 5: January 7, 2017 Saturday
**Today's Progress**: Worked through JavaScript DOM manipulation exercise. Learned a lot about various JavaScript document.get methods. I used JQuery DOM manipulation methods in FCC weather app, but I didn’t have good understanding of them.
Also, I am trying to figure out how to debug JavaScript file with WebStorm IDE. Figured out that, you cannot debug JavaScript file with DOM manipulation in WebStorm IDE because node.js does not understand the DOM structure. It has to debugged in Chrome console. I started working on FCC Wikipedia project... However, I'd like to go through the Udemy course tutorials to improve my understanding on how $ajax and getJSON method works! There is no point in copying and pasting codes just to make something work! 

**Thoughts** The whole process of learning this on my own is overwhelming. I hoping that it all comes together at the end.


### Day 4: January 6, 2017 Friday
**Today's Progress**: Since my JavaScript understanding is not that well, I went through Udemy course lessons and worked on small problems; worked out some algorithms. Once, I am somewhat through it, I will start the next FCC project on Wikipedia.

**Thoughts** The Udemy course by Colt Steels is pretty good. It feels that it all coming together… Need to go through the whole course!


### Day 3: January 5, 2017 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC Weather App. Fixed CSS file, Added Country and displayed it with html. Added hover effect. I already submitted my Weather App, but I will re-submit this new one when I am satisfied with it. 
Also, I worked through Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp. Got through Arrays, worked out some Algorithm problems

**Thoughts** I need to improve my CSS skills. It would help if I knew more about colour theory, so that I can choose the right colour contrast… Also, my JavaScript knowledge is still basic. That’s why I am going through Udemy course; this will help me write better codes.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:  Worked on "Show The Local Weather" project at FCC. I went back to this project after a 3 month of gap... The background pictures were not working as some of the links were broken. I decided to recreate this project with a single background image… Now it’s working

Also, there is problem with http protocol at codepen.io. The project worked just fine on my local machine, but I have to have a extra link which is “https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/” with open weather API call...

**Thoughts** It’s great to be back and committed to learning programming

### Day 1: January 03, 2017 - (joined the challenge)
## Todya's Progress**: Just trying to figure out how github works! How to fork it and how to it... I'd like to work on my project at freecodecamp. I sumbitted the "show the local weather" project, but it does not work with Chrome broser because it used https protocol. I think, this is the best place to start. I have been stuck at this for a few months... This 100 days challenge will motivate me to complete it and move forwards!
