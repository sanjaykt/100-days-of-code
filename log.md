# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: January 5, 2017 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC Weather App. Fixed CSS file, Added Country and displayed it with html. Added hover effect. I already submitted my Weather App, but I will re-submit this new one when I am satisfied with it. 
Also, I worked through Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp. Got through Arrays, worked out some Algorithm problems

**Thoughts** I need to improve my CSS skills. It would help if I knew more about colour theory, so that I can choose the right colour contrast… Also, my JavaScript knowledge is still basic. That’s why I am going through Udemy course; this will help me write better codes.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:  Worked on "Show The Local Weather" project at FCC. I went back to this project after a 3 month of gap... The background pictures were not working as some of the links were broken. I decided to recreate this project with a single background image… Now it’s working

Also, there is problem with http protocol at codepen.io. The project worked just fine on my local machine, but I have to have a extra link which is “https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/” with open weather API call...

**Thoughts** It’s great to be back and committed to learning programming

### Day 1: January 03, 2017 - (joined the challenge)
## Todya's Progress**: Just trying to figure out how github works! How to fork it and how to it... I'd like to work on my project at freecodecamp. I sumbitted the "show the local weather" project, but it does not work with Chrome broser because it used https protocol. I think, this is the best place to start. I have been stuck at this for a few months... This 100 days challenge will motivate me to complete it and move forwards!

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app. 

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
