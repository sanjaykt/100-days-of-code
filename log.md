# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 7: January 9, 2017 Monday
**Today's Progress**: Spent two hours trying to figure out the how to write query string to get data from wikipedia for my FCC Wikipedia project. Read documentation at https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page . This has been a challenge. First of all, I don’t what I was looking at.

So looked at the code (API call) someone wrote in the project and then try to figure out why it was written the way it was written.

There is something call “generator=search” that would bring the result to a search term. Then there is extract and parameters suffix “ex” that I could not figure out what it was.
Also, I worked on writing snippets of code for Udemy JavaScript course.

**Thoughts** This is frustrating business because of the amount of information I have digest and remember, but it is worth it at the end


### Day 6: January 8, 2017 Sunday
**Today's Progress**: Did some JavaScript exercises with Udemy course. Researched how to connect Wikipedia API to my project. It’s very confusing. I had to look at the code others wrote in order to figure it out. I could not figure it reading documentation at Wikipedia; maybe I don’t know what I am looking at.
**Thoughts** Once I know how to fetch data from wikipedia with the search term, it will be easy to iterate through it and display the data


### Day 5: January 7, 2017 Saturday
**Today's Progress**: Worked through JavaScript DOM manipulation exercise. Learned a lot about various JavaScript document.get methods. I used JQuery DOM manipulation methods in FCC weather app, but I didn’t have good understanding of them.
Also, I am trying to figure out how to debug JavaScript file with WebStorm IDE. Figured out that, you cannot debug JavaScript file with DOM manipulation in WebStorm IDE because node.js does not understand the DOM structure. It has to debugged in Chrome console. I started working on FCC Wikipedia project... However, I'd like to go through the Udemy course tutorials to improve my understanding on how $ajax and getJSON method works! There is no point in copying and pasting codes just to make something work! 

**Thoughts** The whole process of learning this on my own is overwhelming. I hoping that it all comes together at the end.


### Day 4: January 6, 2017 Friday
**Today's Progress**: Since my JavaScript understanding is not that well, I went through Udemy course lessons and worked on small problems; worked out some algorithms. Once, I am somewhat through it, I will start the next FCC project on Wikipedia.

**Thoughts** The Udemy course by Colt Steels is pretty good. It feels that it all coming together… Need to go through the whole course!


### Day 3: January 5, 2017 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC Weather App. Fixed CSS file, Added Country and displayed it with html. Added hover effect. I already submitted my Weather App, but I will re-submit this new one when I am satisfied with it. 
Also, I worked through Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp. Got through Arrays, worked out some Algorithm problems

**Thoughts** I need to improve my CSS skills. It would help if I knew more about colour theory, so that I can choose the right colour contrast… Also, my JavaScript knowledge is still basic. That’s why I am going through Udemy course; this will help me write better codes.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:  Worked on "Show The Local Weather" project at FCC. I went back to this project after a 3 month of gap... The background pictures were not working as some of the links were broken. I decided to recreate this project with a single background image… Now it’s working

Also, there is problem with http protocol at codepen.io. The project worked just fine on my local machine, but I have to have a extra link which is “https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/” with open weather API call...

**Thoughts** It’s great to be back and committed to learning programming

### Day 1: January 03, 2017 - (joined the challenge)
## Todya's Progress**: Just trying to figure out how github works! How to fork it and how to it... I'd like to work on my project at freecodecamp. I sumbitted the "show the local weather" project, but it does not work with Chrome broser because it used https protocol. I think, this is the best place to start. I have been stuck at this for a few months... This 100 days challenge will motivate me to complete it and move forwards!

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app. 

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
